# Now to test fetching of config from config server use: http://localhost:8080/retail/dummy/
# we need to place this config in bootstrap file coz controller message prop should get injected even before app props load
# You can refresh the property by hitting POST url : http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh
# Note that in config server properties just changing the props file doesn't have any effect you must commit the file to git
# as config server will read the property values as available in git repository as that's what you have configured, you have not configured local repo.
